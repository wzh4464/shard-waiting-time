Tricolorability is an isotopy invariant, and hence can be used to distinguish between two different (non-isotopic) knots.  In particular, since the unknot is not tricolorable, any tricolorable knot is necessarily nontrivial.},

By the geometric fitting, the error distances are defined with the shortest distances from the given points to the geometric feature to be fitted. For the geometric fitting of ellipse, a robust algorithm is proposed. This is based on the coordinate description of the corresponding point on the ellipse for the given point, where the connecting line of the two points is the shortest path from the given point to the ellipse. As a practical application example, we show the geometric ellipse fitting to the image of circular point targets, where the contour points are weighted with their image gradient across the boundary of the image ellipse.},

The WKS represents the average probability of measuring a quantum mechanical particle at a specific location. By letting vary the energy of the particle, the WKS encodes and separates information from various different Laplace eigenfrequencies. This clear scale separation makes the WKS well suited for a large variety of applications. Both theoretically and in quantitative experiments we demonstrate that the WKS is substantially more discriminative and therefore allows for better feature matching than the commonly used Heat Kernel Signature (HKS). As an application of the WKS in shape analysis we show results on shape matching.},

  abstract = {Balanced graph partitioning is a critical step for many large-scale distributed computations with relational data. As graph datasets have grown in size and density, a range of highly-scalable balanced partitioning algorithms have appeared to meet varied demands across different domains. As the starting point for the present work, we observe that two recently introduced families of iterative partitioners---those based on restreaming and those based on balanced label propagation (including Facebook's Social Hash Partitioner)---can be viewed through a common modular framework of design decisions. With the help of this modular perspective, we find that a key combination of design decisions leads to a novel family of algorithms with notably better empirical performance than any existing highly-scalable algorithm on a broad range of real-world graphs. The resulting prioritized restreaming algorithms employ a constraint management strategy based on multiplicative weights, borrowed from the restreaming literature, while adopting notions of priority from balanced label propagation to optimize the ordering of the streaming process. Our experimental results consider a range of stream orders, where a dynamic ordering based on what we call ambivalence is broadly the most performative in terms of the cut quality of the resulting balanced partitions, with a static ordering based on degree being nearly as good.},

  abstract = {The Hough transform is a method for detecting curves by exploiting the duality between points on a curve and parameters of that curve. The initial work showed how to detect both analytic curves(1,2) and non-analytic curves,(3) but these methods were restricted to binary edge images. This work was generalized to the detection of some analytic curves in grey level images, specifically lines,(4) circles(5) and parabolas.(6) The line detection case is the best known of these and has been ingeniously exploited in several applications.(7,8,9) We show how the boundaries of an arbitrary non-analytic shape can be used to construct a mapping between image space and Hough transform space. Such a mapping can be exploited to detect instances of that particular shape in an image. Furthermore, variations in the shape such as rotations, scale changes or figure ground reversals correspond to straightforward transformations of this mapping. However, the most remarkable property is that such mappings can be composed to build mappings for complex shapes from the mappings of simpler component shapes. This makes the generalized Hough transform a kind of universal transform which can be used to find arbitrarily complex shapes.},

  abstract = {Many machine vision tasks require objects to be delineated during image segmentation that have shapes that are well approximated by circles or ellipses. Due to their computational efficiency least-squares, algebraic methods are a popular choice for fitting an elliptic primitive to noisy image data when real-time processing is required. These methods, however, suffer from biased estimates and sensitivity to outlier data. In this paper a real-time, least-squares method is proposed that provides an indirect geometric fit based on the quadratic polynomial form of parallel chord lengths. The algorithm is shown to be more computationally efficient and more easily made robust to outlier data than algebraic methods. Experimental results also suggest that it provides estimates that suffer less from bias error.},

  abstract = {String theory is one of the most exciting and challenging areas of modern theoretical physics. This book guides the reader from the basics of string theory to very recent developments at the frontier of string theory research. The book begins with the basics of perturbative string theory, world-sheet supersymmetry, space-time supersymmetry, conformal field theory and the heterotic string, and moves on to describe modern developments, including D-branes, string dualities and M-theory. It then covers string geometry (including Calabi\textendash Yau compactifications) and flux compactifications, and applications to cosmology and particle physics. One chapter is dedicated to black holes in string theory and M-theory, and the microscopic origin of black-hole entropy. The book concludes by presenting matrix theory, AdS/CFT duality and its generalizations. This book is ideal for graduate students studying modern string theory, and it will make an excellent textbook for a 1-year course on string theory. It will also be useful for researchers interested in learning about developments in modern string theory. The book contains about 120 solved exercises, as well as about 200 homework problems, solutions of which are available for lecturers on a password protected website at www.cambridge.org/9780521860697.},

  abstract = {In recent years a considerable amount of work in graphics and geometric optimization used tools based on the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a surface. The applications of the Laplacian include mesh editing, surface smoothing, and shape interpolations among others. However, it has been shown [13, 24, 26] that the popular cotangent approximation schemes do not provide convergent point-wise (or even {$\mathscr{L}$}2) estimates, while many applications rely on point-wise estimation. Existence of such schemes has been an open question [13]. In this paper we propose the first algorithm for approximating the Laplace operator of a surface from a mesh with point-wise convergence guarantees applicable to arbitrary meshed surfaces. We show that for a sufficiently fine mesh over an arbitrary surface, our mesh Laplacian is close to the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the surface at every point of the surface. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is simple and easily imple-mentable. Experimental evidence shows that our algorithm exhibits convergence empirically and compares favorably with cotangent-based methods in providing accurate approximation of the Laplace operator for various meshes.

  abstract = {Balanced edge partition has emerged as a new approach to partition an input graph data for the purpose of scaling out parallel computations, which is of interest for several modern data analytics computation platforms, including platforms for iterative computations, machine learning problems, and graph databases. This new approach stands in a stark contrast to the traditional approach of balanced vertex partition, where for given number of partitions, the problem is to minimize the number of edges cut subject to balancing the vertex cardinality of partitions. In this paper, we first characterize the expected costs of vertex and edge partitions with and without aggregation of messages, for the commonly deployed policy of placing a vertex or an edge uniformly at random to one of the partitions. We then obtain the first approximation algorithms for the balanced edge-partition problem which for the case of no aggregation matches the best known approximation ratio for the balanced vertex-partition problem, and show that this remains to hold for the case with aggregation up to factor that is equal to the maximum in-degree of a vertex. We report results of an extensive empirical evaluation on a set of real-world graphs, which quantifies the benefits of edge- vs. vertex-partition, and demonstrates efficiency of natural greedy online assignments for the balanced edge-partition problem with and with no aggregation.},

Recently, heat kernel signature was introduced as an intrinsic local shape descriptor based on diffusion scale-space analysis. In this paper, we develop a scale-invariant version of the heat kernel descriptor. Our construction is based on a logarithmically sampled scale-space in which shape scaling corresponds, up to a multiplicative constant, to a translation. This translation is undone using the magnitude of the Fourier transform. The proposed scale-invariant local descriptors can be used in the bag-of-features framework for shape retrieval in the presence of transformations such as isometric deformations, missing data, topological noise, and global and local scaling. We get significant performance improvement over state-of-the-art algorithms on recently established non-rigid shape retrieval benchmarks.},

This paper presents an ellipse detection method combining the advantages of Hough transform(HT) based methods and the advantages of edge following methods, which is capable of detecting fragmented ellipses and is both computational and memory efficient. Our method works in two steps. In the first step, an edge following method is proposed to quickly and accurately extract the majority of ellipses. For ellipses missed in the first step, candidate regions where each may contain one missed ellipse are extracted in the second step using cluster analysis, and then a HT based method is performed on these regions to extract the missed ellipses. This can not only guarantee the accuracy of the HT based method, but also save the memory and computation time. We test the performance of our method using both synthetic images and low SNR industrial images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs far better than existing methods in terms of recall, precision, F-measure, and reliability. Especially in term of reliability, our method has achieved a very high value close to 1 while the reliabilities of state-of-the art methods are almost less than 0.5.},

We investigate the equilibrium of the game, and design a polynomial-time algorithm to find efficient equilibria with good system performance. We further design a novel sharding protocol with dynamic user distribution for the permissionless blockchain, and the protocol can maintain good performance in long-term dynamic environment. Extensive numerical results using realistic blockchain transaction data demonstrate that the proposed algorithm and the designed protocol can achieve superior performance for shard-based blockchains.},

We extract hypothetical ellipses of an image by fitting an ellipse to the elliptical-arcs of each group. Finally, a feedback loop is developed to sieve out low confidence hypothetical ellipses and to regenerate a better set of hypothetical ellipses. In this aspect, the proposed algorithm performs self-correction and homes in on ``difficult'' ellipses. Detailed evaluation on synthetic images shows that the algorithm outperforms existing methods substantially in terms of recall and precision scores under the scenarios of image cluttering, salt-and-pepper noise and partial occlusion. Additionally, we apply the detector on a set of challenging real-world images. Successful detection of ellipses present in these images is demonstrated. We are not aware of any other work that can detect ellipses from such difficult images. Therefore, this work presents a significant contribution towards ellipse detection.},

  abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the most powerful tools in machine learning. The simplest method for PCA, the power iteration, requires \$\textbackslash mathcal O(1/\textbackslash Delta)\$ full-data passes to recover the principal component of a matrix with eigen-gap \$\textbackslash Delta\$. Lanczos, a significantly more complex method, achieves an accelerated rate of \$\textbackslash mathcal O(1/\textbackslash sqrt\{\textbackslash Delta\})\$ passes. Modern applications, however, motivate methods that only ingest a subset of available data, known as the stochastic setting. In the online stochastic setting, simple algorithms like Oja's iteration achieve the optimal sample complexity \$\textbackslash mathcal O(\textbackslash sigma\^2/\textbackslash Delta\^2)\$. Unfortunately, they are fully sequential, and also require \$\textbackslash mathcal O(\textbackslash sigma\^2/\textbackslash Delta\^2)\$ iterations, far from the \$\textbackslash mathcal O(1/\textbackslash sqrt\{\textbackslash Delta\})\$ rate of Lanczos. We propose a simple variant of the power iteration with an added momentum term, that achieves both the optimal sample and iteration complexity. In the full-pass setting, standard analysis shows that momentum achieves the accelerated rate, \$\textbackslash mathcal O(1/\textbackslash sqrt\{\textbackslash Delta\})\$. We demonstrate empirically that naively applying momentum to a stochastic method, does not result in acceleration. We perform a novel, tight variance analysis that reveals the "breaking-point variance" beyond which this acceleration does not occur. By combining this insight with modern variance reduction techniques, we construct stochastic PCA algorithms, for the online and offline setting, that achieve an accelerated iteration complexity \$\textbackslash mathcal O(1/\textbackslash sqrt\{\textbackslash Delta\})\$. Due to the embarassingly parallel nature of our methods, this acceleration translates directly to wall-clock time if deployed in a parallel environment. Our approach is very general, and applies to many non-convex optimization problems that can now be accelerated using the same technique.},

The method adopts arcs selection, smart grouping, and repeated utilization of gradient information to significantly reduce the computations otherwise needed without compromising the detection effectiveness. Geometric properties calculable with few computations, such as arc smoothness, relative placement of curves, and region of confidence for ellipse centres, are utilized for this purpose. An exhaustive sensitivity analysis of the method's control parameters has been performed. It reveals range of values that support consistent performance over diverse challenging datasets with complex background, multiple differently sized ellipses, and occluded, overlapping ellipses. The method's performance is compared with six state-of-the-art detectors over four diverse datasets. Among all the tested methods, the proposed method demonstrates the best balance between detection effectiveness (the best or the second best F-measure scores) and computation time ({$>$}40 Hz) across all the datasets.},

  abstract = {It is known that Maxwell's electrodynamics\textemdash as usually understood at the present time\textemdash when applied to moving bodies, leads to asymmetries which do not appear to be inherent in the phenomena. Take, for example, the reciprocal electrodynamic action of a magnet and a conductor. The observable phenomenon here depends only on the relative motion of the conductor and the magnet, whereas the customary view draws a sharp distinction between the two cases in which either the one or the other of these bodies is in motion. For if the magnet is in motion and the conductor at rest, there arises in the neighbourhood of the magnet an electric field with a certain definite energy, producing a current at the places where parts of the conductor are situated. But if the magnet is stationary and the conductor in motion, no electric field arises in the neighbourhood of the magnet. In the conductor, however, we find an electromotive force, to which in itself there is no corresponding energy, but which gives rise\textemdash assuming equality of relative motion in the two cases discussed\textemdash to electric currents of the same path and intensity as those produced by the electric forces in the former case.  Examples of this sort, together with the unsuccessful attempts to discover any motion of the earth relatively to the ``light medium,'' suggest that the phenomena of electrodynamics as well as of mechanics possess no properties corresponding to the idea of absolute rest. They suggest rather that, as has already been shown to the first order of small quantities, the same laws of electrodynamics and optics will be valid for all frames of reference for which the equations of mechanics hold good.1 We will raise this conjecture (the purport of which will hereafter be called the ``Principle of Relativity'') to the status of a postulate, and also introduce another postulate, which is only apparently irreconcilable with the former, namely, that light is always propagated in empty space with a definite velocity c which is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body. These two postulates suffice for the attainment of a simple and consistent theory of the electrodynamics of moving bodies based on Maxwell's theory for stationary bodies. The introduction of a ``luminiferous ether'' will prove to be superfluous inasmuch as the view here to be developed will not require an ``absolutely stationary space'' provided with special properties, nor assign a velocity-vector to a point of the empty space in which electromagnetic processes take place.  The theory to be developed is based\textemdash like all electrodynamics\textemdash on the kinematics of the rigid body, since the assertions of any such theory have to do with the relationships between rigid bodies (systems of co-ordinates), clocks, and electromagnetic processes. Insufficient consideration of this circumstance lies at the root of the difficulties which the electrodynamics of moving bodies at present encounters.},

A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system.

Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

The task of identifying water eddies in sea surface temperature maps (SST) is time-consuming for oceanographers due to the large number of SST available. This motivates the present investigation aiming to develop an automatic system capable of performing that task. The system developed consists of a pre-processing stage where a vectorial field is calculated using an optical flow algorithm with one SST map and a matrix of zeros for input. Next, a binary image of the modulus of the vectorial field is created using an iterative thresholding algorithm. Finally, five edge points of the binary image, classified according to their gradient vector direction, are randomly selected and an ellipse corresponding to a water eddy fitted to them.},

In this paper, we consider the case of producing block-diagonal biclusters. We provide a new formulation of the biclustering problem based on the idea of minimizing the empirical clustering risk. We develop and prove a consistency result with respect to the empirical clustering risk. Since the optimization problem is combinatorial in nature, finding the global minimum is computationally intractable. In light of this fact, we propose a simple and novel algorithm that finds a local minimum by alternating the use of an adapted version of the k-means clustering algorithm between columns and rows. We evaluate and compare the performance of our algorithm to other related biclustering methods on both simulated data and real-world gene expression data sets. The results demonstrate that our algorithm is able to detect meaningful structures in the data and outperform other competing biclustering methods in various settings and situations.},

  abstract = {Fitting circles and ellipses to given points in the plane is a problem that arises in many application areas, e.g., computer graphics, coordinate meteorology, petroleum engineering, statistics. In the past, algorithms have been given which fit circles and ellipses in some least-squares sense without minimizing the geometric distance to the given points. In this paper we present several algorithms which compute the ellipse for which the sum of the squares of the distances to the given points is minimal. These algorithms are compared with classical simple and iterative methods. Circles and ellipses may be represented algebraically, i.e., by an equation of the form F(x)=0. If a point is on the curve, then its coordinates x are a zero of the function F. Alternatively, curves may be represented in parametric form, which is well suited for minimizing the sum of the squares of the distances. \textcopyright{} 1994 the BIT Foundation.},

This topic was first studied from the standpoint of sparse matrices and vertex elimination in graphs. Today we know that minimal triangulations are closely related to minimal separators of the input graph. Since the first papers presenting minimal triangulation algorithms appeared in 1976, several characterizations of minimal triangulations have been proved, and a variety of algorithms exist for computing minimal triangulations of both general and restricted graph classes. This survey presents and ties together these results in a unified modern notation, keeping an emphasis on the algorithms.},

We adopt a model for airborne transmission risk in an enclosed room that considers room properties, mask efficiency, and initial infection probability of the occupants. Additionally, we study the effect of vaccination on the spread of the virus. The presented model has been evaluated in simulations using fall 2019 (prepandemic) and fall 2020 (hybrid instruction) course registration data of a large US university, allowing for assessing the difference in transmission risk between in-person and hybrid programs and the impact of occupancy reduction, mask-wearing, and vaccination. The simulations indicate that without vaccination, moving 90\% of the classes online leads to a 17 to 18\texttimes{} reduction in new cases, and universal mask usage results in an {$\sim$}2.7 to 3.6\texttimes{} reduction in new infections through classroom interactions. Furthermore, the results indicate that for the original variant and using vaccines with efficacy greater than 90\%, at least 23\% (64\%) of students need to be vaccinated with (without) mask usage in order to operate the university at full occupancy while preventing an increase in cases due to classroom interactions. For the more contagious variant, even with universal mask usage, at least 93\% of the students need to be vaccinated to ensure the same conditions. We show that the model is able to predict trends observed in weekly infection rates for fall 2021.},

Even though the proposed approach is handicapped by only taking into consideration local parts of the graph when reassigning vertices, extensive evaluation shows that the proposed approach maintains a quality partitioning over time, which is comparable at any point in time to performing a full partitioning from scratch using a state-the-art static graph partitioning algorithm such as METIS. Furthermore, when vertex replication is turned on, edge-cut can improve by an order of magnitude.},

However, in recent years much progress has been made in these areas. In this review we discuss ideas for the efficient implementation of the HT and present results on the analytic and empirical performance of various methods. We also report the relationship of Hough methods and other transforms and consider applications in which the HT has been used. It seems likely that the HT will be an increasingly used technique and we hope that this survey will provide a useful guide to quickly acquaint researchers with the main literature in this research area. \textcopyright{} 1988 Academic Press, Inc.

Existing methods are hardly applicable to these real-time scenarios of limited hardware resource due to the huge number of fragment candidates (edges or arcs) for fitting ellipse equations. In this paper, we present a fast algorithm detecting ellipses with high accuracy. The algorithm leverages a newly developed projective invariant to significantly prune the undesired candidates and to pick out elliptical ones. The invariant is able to reflect the intrinsic geometry of a planar curve, giving the value of -1 on any three collinear points and +1 for any six points on an ellipse. Thus, we apply the pruning and picking by simply comparing these binary values. Moreover, the calculation of the invariant only involves the determinant of a \$3\textbackslash times 3\$ matrix. Extensive experiments on three challenging data sets with 648 images demonstrate that our detector runs 20\%-50\% faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms with the comparable or higher precision.},

  abstract = {This work extends the circle fitting method of Rangarajan and Kanatani (2009) to accommodate ellipse fitting. Our method, which we call HyperLS, relies on algebraic distance minimization with a carefully chosen scale normalization. The normalization is derived using a rigorous error analysis of least squares (LS) estimators so that statistical bias is eliminated up to second order noise terms. Numerical evidence suggests that the proposed HyperLS estimator is far superior to the standard LS and is slightly better than the Taubin estimator. Although suboptimal in comparison to maximum likelihood (ML), our HyperLS does not require iterations. Hence, it does not suffer from convergence issues due to poor initialization, which is inherent in ML estimators. In this sense, the proposed HyperLS is a perfect candidate for initializing the ML iterations. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

From the early work it was clear that multilevel techniques held great promise; however, it was not knownif they can be made to consistently produce high quality partitions for graphs arising in a wide range of application domains. We investigate the effectiveness of many different choices for all three phases: coarsening, partition of the coarsest graph, and refinement. In particular, we present a new coarsening heuristic (called heavy-edge heuristic) for which the size of the partition of the coarse graph is within a small factor of the size of the final partition obtained after multilevel refinement. We also present a much faster variation of the Kernighan--Lin (KL) algorithm for refining during uncoarsening. We test our scheme on a large number of graphs arising in various domains including finite element methods, linear programming, VLSI, and transportation. Our experiments show that our scheme produces partitions that are consistently better than those produced by spectral partitioning schemes in substantially smaller time. Also, when our scheme is used to compute fill-reducing orderings for sparse matrices, it produces orderings that have substantially smaller fill than the widely used multiple minimum degree algorithm.},

The blockchain is maintained and updated by mining process in which a number of nodes called miners compete for finding answers of very difficult puzzle-like problem. Transactions issued by users are grouped into a block, and the block is added to the blockchain when an algorithmic puzzle specialized for the block is solved. A recent study reveals that newly arriving transactions are not included in the block being under mining. In this paper, we model the mining process with a queueing system with batch service, analyzing the transaction-confirmation time. We consider an \$\$M/\textbackslash text\{ G \}\^B/1\$\$M/GB/1with batch service, in which a newly arriving transaction cannot enter the service facility even when the number of transactions in the service facility does not reach the maximum batch size, i.e., the block-size limit. In this model, the sojourn time of a transaction corresponds to its confirmation time. We consider the joint distribution of the number of transactions in system and the elapsed service time, deriving the mean transaction-confirmation time. In numerical examples, we show how the block-size limit affects the transaction-confirmation time.},

The intelligent ability to learn these non-verbal cues of the humans is the key characteristic to develop efficient human computer interaction systems. Extracting an effective representation from facial expression images is a crucial step that impacts the recognition accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel feature selection strategy using singular value decomposition (SVD) based co-clustering to search for the most salient regions in terms of facial features that possess a high discriminating ability among all expressions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first known attempt to explicitly perform co-clustering in the facial expression recognition domain. In our method, Gabor filters are used to extract local features from an image and then discriminant features are selected based on the class membership in co-clusters. Experiments demonstrate that co-clustering localizes the salient regions of the face image. Not only does the procedure reduce the dimensionality but also improves the recognition accuracy. Experiments on CK plus, JAFFE and MMI databases validate the existence and effectiveness of these learned facial features.},

  abstract = {Blockchain has many benefits including decentralization, availability, persistency, consistency, anonymity, auditability and accountability, and it also covers a wide spectrum of applications ranging from cryptocurrency, financial services, reputation system, Internet of Things, sharing economy to public and social services. Not only may blockchain be regarded as a by-product of Bitcoin cryptocurrency systems, but also it is a type of distributed ledger technologies through using a trustworthy, decentralized log of totally ordered transactions. By summarizing the literature of blockchain, it is found that more and more important research is to develop basic theory, for example, mathematical models (Markov processes, queueing theory and game models) for mining management and consensus mechanism, performance analysis and optimization of blockchain systems. In this paper, we develop queueing theory of blockchain systems and provide system performance evaluation. To do this, we design a Markovian batch-service queueing system with two different service stages, which are suitable to well express the mining process in the miners pool and the building of a new blockchain. By using the matrix-geometric solution, we obtain a system stable condition and express three key performance measures: (a) The average number of transactions in the queue, (b) the average number of transactions in a block, and (c) the average transaction-confirmation time. Finally, we use numerical examples to verify computability of our theoretical results. Although our queueing model here is simple only under exponential or Poisson assumptions, our analytic method will open a series of potentially promising research in queueing theory of blockchain systems.},

It has been repeatedly shown that these methods can be useful for dealing with a wide range of structural geometries, even those for which the assumption is only approximately valid, e.g. structures produced by the interference of superimposed fold sets. In some instances though, such as in the analysis of oil-field structures, it is the presence and type of non-cylindricity in a structure which is of primary interest. The description of such folded surfaces requires more general methods of analyzing surface curvature based on the principles of differential geometry. The Mohr circle construction, already familiar to structural geologists in the context of stress and strain, is shown to be useful for the analysis of surface curvature and torsion. A practical method of mapping principal curvatures and their trajectories, involving the application of the Mohr circle, is described and applied, by way of example, for the survey of the Goose Egg Dome in Wyoming and a small-scale fold from Laksefjord, Norway.},

The method aims at clearly removing the lines and curves which are not ellipse edges to improve the ellipse fitting. In arc extraction, the arcs are divided into four categories according to the gradient, and the size constraint is exploited to remove the interference lines. Then, the arc relative position constraints and the tangent lines constraint are employed to exactly group the arcs that belong to the same ellipse into a set. Finally, a post-processing approach is developed to remove the invalid ellipses. Due to the effective removal of the interference edges and the designed geometric multi-constraint, the computational costs of arc grouping and parameter estimation are dramatically reduced, and the fitting results are finely agreeable to the actual ellipse contours. The performance is evaluated with 3600 synthetic images and 1517 real images, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method runs much faster than the current speed leading methods with the comparable or higher F-measure.},

In this paper, we propose a valuable industry-oriented ellipse detector by arc-support line segments, which simultaneously reaches high detection accuracy and efficiency. To simplify the complicated curves in an image while retaining the general properties including convexity and polarity, the arc-support line segments are extracted, which grounds the successful detection of ellipses. The arc-support groups are formed by iteratively and robustly linking the arc-support line segments that latently belong to a common ellipse. Afterward, two complementary approaches, namely, locally selecting the arc-support group with higher saliency and globally searching all the valid paired groups, are adopted to fit the initial ellipses in a fast way. Then, the ellipse candidate set can be formulated by hierarchical clustering of 5D parameter space of initial ellipses. Finally, the salient ellipse candidates are selected and refined as detections subject to the stringent and effective verification. Extensive experiments on three public datasets are implemented and our method achieves the best F-measure scores compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Therefore, it is challenging to securely implement data aggregation and power dispatching in microgrids without any trusted third party.

First, it was revealed that the confocal hyperbola distance considerably outperforms other distance approximations such as algebraic and Sampson. Next, the proposed ellipse fitting method was compared with five reliable and established methods proposed by Halir, Taubin, Kanatani, Ahn and Szpak. The performance of each method as a function of rotation, aspect ratio, noise, and arc-length were examined. It was observed that the proposed ellipse fitting method achieved almost identical results (and in some cases better) than the gold standard geometric method of Ahn and outperformed the remaining methods in all simulation experiments. Finally, the proposed method outperformed the considered ellipse fitting methods in estimating the geometric parameters of cylindrical mechanical pipes from point clouds. The results of the experiments show that the confocal hyperbola is an excellent approximation to the true geometric distance and produces reliable and accurate ellipse fitting in practical settings.},

Next, arc segments that belong to the same ellipse are grouped together. Finally, a robust statistical method, namely RANSAC, is applied to fit ellipses to groups of arc segments. Unlike Hough Transform based algorithms, this method does not need a high dimensional parameter space, and so it reduces the computation and storage requirements.

  abstract = {Fast and accurate ellipse detection is critical in certain computer vision tasks. In this paper, we propose an arc adjacency matrix-based ellipse detection (AAMED) method to fulfill this requirement. At first, after segmenting the edges into elliptic arcs, the digraph-based arc adjacency matrix (AAM) is constructed to describe their triple sequential adjacency states. Curvature and region constraints are employed to make the AAM sparse. Secondly, through bidirectionally searching the AAM, we can get all arc combinations which are probably true ellipse candidates. The cumulative-factor (CF) based cumulative matrices (CM) are worked out simultaneously. CF is irrelative to the image context and can be pre-calculated. CM is related to the arcs or arc combinations and can be calculated by the addition or subtraction of CF. Then the ellipses are efficiently fitted from these candidates through twice eigendecomposition of CM using Jacobi method. Finally, a comprehensive validation score is proposed to eliminate false ellipses effectively. The score is mainly influenced by the constraints about adaptive shape, tangent similarity, distribution compensation. Experiments show that our method outperforms the 12 state-of-the-art methods on 9 datasets as a whole, with reference to recall, precision, F-measure, and time-consumption.},

Yet, versatile frameworks for cell shape quantification, comparison, and classification remain underdeveloped. Here, we introduce a visibility graph representation of shapes that facilitates network-driven characterization and analyses across shapes encountered in different domains. Using the example of complex shape of leaf pavement cells, we show that our framework accurately quantifies cell protrusions and invaginations and provides additional functionality in comparison to the contending approaches. We further show that structural properties of the visibility graphs can be used to quantify pavement cell shape complexity and allow for classification of plants into their respective phylogenetic clades. Therefore, the visibility graphs provide a robust and unique framework to accurately quantify and classify the shape of different objects.},

  abstract = {Co-clustering is a generalization of unsupervised clustering that has recently drawn renewed attention, driven by emerging data mining applications in diverse areas. Whereas clustering groups entire columns of a data matrix, co-clustering groups columns over select rows only, i.e., it simultaneously groups rows and columns. The concept generalizes to data ``boxes'' and higher-way tensors, for simultaneous grouping along multiple modes. Various co-clustering formulations have been proposed, but no workhorse analogous to K-means has emerged. This paper starts from K-means and shows how co-clustering can be formulated as a constrained multilinear decomposition with sparse latent factors. For three- and higher-way data, uniqueness of the multilinear decomposition implies that, unlike matrix co-clustering, it is possible to unravel a large number of possibly overlapping co-clusters. A basic multi-way co-clustering algorithm is proposed that exploits multilinearity using Lasso-type coordinate updates. Various line search schemes are then introduced to speed up convergence, and suitable modifications are proposed to deal with missing values. The imposition of latent sparsity pays a collateral dividend: it turns out that sequentially extracting one co-cluster at a time is almost optimal, hence the approach scales well for large datasets. The resulting algorithms are benchmarked against the state-of-art in pertinent simulations, and applied to measured data, including the ENRON e-mail corpus.},

Classification is performed with a multiobjective deep hierarchical pyramidal neural network, thus performing a multilevel analysis of the description.

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel ellipse detection method for real images. The proposed method uses the information of edge curvature and their convexity in relation to other edge contours as clues for identifying edge contours that can be grouped together. A search region is computed for every edge contour that contains other edge contours eligible for grouping with the current edge contour. A two-dimensional Hough transform is performed in an intermediate step, in which we use a new 'relationship score' for ranking the edge contours in a group, instead of the conventional histogram count. The score is found to be more selective and thus more efficient. In addition, we use three novel saliency criteria, that are non-heuristic and consider various aspects for quantifying the goodness of the detected elliptic hypotheses and finally selecting good elliptic hypotheses. The thresholds for selection of elliptic hypotheses are determined by the detected hypotheses themselves, such that the selection is free from human intervention. The method requires a few seconds in most cases. So, it is suitable for practical applications. The performance of the proposed ellipse detection method has been tested on a dataset containing 1200 synthetic images and the Caltech 256 dataset containing real images. In both cases, the results show that the proposed ellipse detection method performs far better than existing methods and is close to the ideal results, with precision, recall, and F-measure, all very close to 1. Further, the method is robust to the increase in the complexity of the images (such as overlapping ellipses, occluded ellipses), while the performance of the contemporary methods deteriorates significantly. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This capability is shown to reduce the experimental uncertainties of the estimated parameters. The systematic errors caused by the two different acquisition channels are measured and taken into account.

Setting A + C = 1 produces more eccentric conics, resulting either in over-elongated ellipses or hyperbolae. Although the F = 1 normalisation is less well suited than the A + C = 1 normalisation with respect to singularities and transformational invariance both these problems are solved by normalising the data, shifting it so that it is centred on the origin before shifting fitting, and then re-expressing the fit in the original frame of reference.},

  abstract = {Quantifying cell morphology is fundamental to the statistical study of cell populations, and can help unravel mechanisms underlying cell and tissue morphogenesis. Current methods, however, require extensive human intervention, are highly parameter sensitive, or produce metrics difficult to interpret biologically. We therefore developed a method, Lobe Contribution Elliptical Fourier Analysis (LOCO-EFA), which generates from digitalised 2D cell outlines meaningful descriptors that can be directly matched to morphological features. This is shown by studying well-defined geometric shapes as well as actual biological cells from plant and animal tissues. LOCO-EFA provides a tool to phenotype efficiently and objectively populations of cells, here demonstrated by applying it to the complex shaped pavement cells of Arabidopsis thaliana wild type and speechless leaves, and Drosophila amnioserosa cells. To validate our method's applicability on large populations, we analysed computer-generated tissues. By controlling in silico cell shape, we explored the potential impact of cell packing on individual cell shape, quantifying through LOCO-EFA deviations between the specified shape of single cells in isolation and the resultant shape when they interact within a confluent tissue.},

In this paper a new algorithm to measure the ellipticity of steel coils using a machine vision system is presented. Traditional algorithms for ellipse detection based on least squares fitting can not be directly applied to this problem, since they lead to ellipses with a very high ellipticity if the amount of fitting data is small. In our new concentric ellipse fitting least squares algorithm the additional information, that the elliptic input curves are concentric, is used to increase the amount of available input data, to estimate the ellipticity even if the curve segments are very short. In this paper the results of a traditional ellipse fitting algorithm are compared to those of the new concentric ellipse fitting algorithm. Furthermore the preprocessing tasks (Hough transform, edge detection, curve filtering), which lead to the fitting data, are described in detail. Finally a simulation of the radius dependency of the ellipticity is done, which is compared to the results of the algorithm.},

Here we develop a computational model for cell motion that uses the phase-field method to solve for the moving boundary with physical membrane properties. It includes a reaction-diffusion model for the actin-myosin machinery and discrete adhesion sites which can be in a "gripping" or "slipping" mode and integrates the adhesion dynamics with the dynamics of the actin filaments, modeled as a viscous network. To test this model, we apply it to fish keratocytes, fast moving cells that maintain their morphology, and show that we are able to reproduce recent experimental results on actin flow and stress patterns. Furthermore, we explore the phase diagram of cell motility by varying myosin II activity and adhesion strength. Our model suggests that the pattern of the actin flow inside the cell, the cell velocity, and the cell morphology are determined by the integration of actin polymerization, myosin contraction, adhesion forces, and membrane forces.},

  abstract = {Detecting ellipses from images is a fundamental task in many computer vision applications. However, due to the complexity of real-world scenarios, it is still a challenge to detect ellipses accurately and efficiently. In this paper, we propose a novel method to tackle this problem based on the fast computation of convex hull and directed graph, which achieves promising results on both accuracy and efficiency. We use Depth-First-Search to extract branch-free curves after adaptive edge detection. Line segments are used to represent the curvature characteristic of the curves, followed by splitting at sharp corners and inflection points to attain smooth arcs. Then the convex hull is constructed, together with the distance, length, and direction constraints, to find co-elliptic arc pairs. Arcs and their connectivity are encoded into a sparse directed graph, and then ellipses are generated via a fast access of the adjacency list. Finally, salient ellipses are selected subject to strict verification and weighted clustering. Extensive experiments are conducted on eight real-world datasets (six publicly available and two built by ourselves), as well as five synthetic datasets. Our method achieves the overall highest F-measure with competitive speed compared to representative state-of-the-art methods.},

First, line segments are extracted and classified into one of three categories: straight line, elliptic line, and pseudo-elliptic line segments. Then elliptic segments are fitted directly with non-iterative ellipse-specific method proposed by Fitzgibbon et al[12]. For pseudo-elliptic segments, we start fitting ellipse with large eccentricity, merge nearby pseudo-elliptic segments that share same monotonicity, validate fitted ellipse, and accept if validation succeeds. If validation fails, fitting process is repeated by lowering eccentricity until either validation succeeds or eccentricity hits zero. We tested the method on some satellite image and obtained good results.},

Perhaps the most important question that will affect Bitcoin's success, is whether or not it will be able to scale to support the high volume of transactions required from a global currency system. We investigate the implications of having a higher transaction throughput on Bitcoin's security against double-spend attacks. We show that at high throughput, substantially weaker attackers are able to reverse payments they have made, even well after they were considered accepted by recipients. We address this security concern through the GHOST rule, a modification to the way Bitcoin nodes construct and re-organize the block chain, Bitcoin's core distributed data-structure. GHOST has been adopted and a variant of it has been implemented as part of the Ethereum project, a second generation distributed applications platform.},

A standard approach distributes the graph over a cluster of nodes, but performing computations on a distributed graph is expensive if large amount of data have to be moved. Without partitioning the graph, communication quickly becomes a limiting factor in scaling the system up. Existing graph partitioning heuristics incur high computation and communication cost on large graphs, sometimes as high as the future computation itself. Observing that the graph has to be loaded into the cluster, we ask if the partitioning can be done at the same time with a lightweight streaming algorithm.},

Currently, practitioners must choose between algebraic methods that guarantee an ellipse fit but exhibit high bias, and geometric methods that are less biased but may no longer guarantee an ellipse solution. We address this limitation by proposing a method that strikes a balance between these two objectives. Specifically, we propose a fast stable algorithm for fitting a guaranteed ellipse to data using the Sampson distance as a data-parameter discrepancy measure. We validate the stability, accuracy, and efficiency of our method on both real and synthetic data. Experimental results show that our algorithm is a fast and accurate approximation of the computationally more expensive orthogonal-distance-based ellipse fitting method. In view of these qualities, our method may be of interest to practitioners who require accurate and guaranteed ellipse estimates. \textcopyright{} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract = {A simple and fast ellipse estimation method is presented based on optimisation of the Sampson distance serving as a measure of the quality of fit between a candidate ellipse and data points. Generation of ellipses, not just conics, as estimates is ensured through the use of a parametrisation of the set of all ellipses. Optimisation of the Sampson distance is performed with the aid of a custom variant of the Levenberg\textendash Marquardt algorithm. The method is supplemented with a measure of uncertainty of an ellipse fit in two closely related forms. One of these concerns the uncertainty in the algebraic parameters of the fit and the other pertains to the uncertainty in the geometrically meaningful parameters of the fit such as the centre, axes, and major axis orientation. In addition, a means is provided for visualising the uncertainty of an ellipse fit in the form of planar confidence regions. For moderate noise levels, the proposed estimator produces results that are fully comparable in accuracy to those produced by the much slower maximum likelihood estimator. Due to its speed and simplicity, the method may prove useful in numerous industrial applications where a measure of reliability for geometric ellipse parameters is required.},

  abstract = {This paper considers eye images observed by a system such as an infrared eye-movement observation system in which the relative position of the head and camera is kept constant. A highly accurate detection method for the pupil image is proposed. Assuming that the eyeball has a spherical shape and the contour of the pupil is a circle, the pupil is observed as an ellipse accompanying movement of the eyeball. By accurately detecting this pupil image of elliptical shape, it is possible to detect the eye direction stably. Various methods of detecting an ellipse have been presented, and the Hough transform is one of these. The Hough transform has the feature that it is less affected by noise and occlusion. In the detection of ellipses in general, the number of degrees of freedom is represented by five parameters to be determined, which may produce problems of computational complexity and memory requirements. On the other hand, in order that the pupil may rotate around the eyeball center, the pupil image observed depends on a position and a direction from the eyeball center, without becoming general ellipse form. In this study, the above constraint is utilized, and an algorithm is discussed in which the pupil is detected with high accuracy based on the eyeball model. In the algorithm, the processing efficiency of the whole system is considered. In the algorithm, first, initial detection of the pupil is performed by ellipse fitting based on the edges in multiple observed images, and the parameters of the eyeball model are estimated on the basis of the results. Then, the Hough transform is applied on the basis of the estimated eyeball parameters, and the pupil contour is detected with high accuracy. The experimental results show that the accuracy and stability of pupil contour detection is improved, indicating that the proposed method is effective. \textcopyright{} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {When broadcasting sports events such as football, it is useful to be able to place virtual annotations on the pitch, to indicate things such as distances between players and the goal, or whether a player is offside. This requires the camera position, orientation, and focal length to be estimated in real time, so that the graphics can be rendered to match the camera view. Whilst this can be achieved by using sensors on the camera mount and lens, they can be impractical or expensive to install, and often the broadcaster only has access to the video feed itself. This paper presents a method for computing the position, orientation and focal length of a camera in real time, using image analysis. The method uses markings on the pitch, such as arcs and lines, to compute the camera pose. A novel feature of the method is the use of multiple images to improve the accuracy of the camera position estimate. A means of automatically initialising the tracking process is also presented, which makes use of a modified form of Hough transform. The paper shows how a carefully chosen set of algorithms can provide fast, robust and accurate tracking for this real-world application.},

Due to the special structure of the blockchain, it has been deemed impossible to directly trade between traditional currencies and cryptocurrencies or between different types of cryptocurrencies. Generally, trading between different currencies is conducted through a centralized third-party platform. However, it has the problem of a single point of failure, which is vulnerable to attacks and thus affects the security of the transactions. In this paper, we propose a distributed cryptocurrency trading scheme to solve the problem of centralized exchanges, which can achieve secure trading between different types of cryptocurrencies. Our scheme is implemented with smart contracts on an Ethereum blockchain and deployed on an Ethereum test network. In addition to implementing transactions between individual users, our scheme also allows transactions among multiple users. The experimental result proves that the cost of our scheme is acceptable.},

We developed the open source MATLAB application CellGeo, a user-friendly computational platform to allow simultaneous, automated tracking and analysis of dynamic changes in cell shape, including protrusions ranging from filopodia to lamellipodia. Our method maps an arbitrary cell shape onto a tree graph that, unlike traditional skeletonization algorithms, preserves complex boundary features.

However, the choice of these hyperparameters has always been challenging in both theory and practice. The {$\nu$}-support vector regression eliminates the need to specify an {$\epsilon$} value elegantly, but at the cost of specifying or postulating a {$\nu$} value. We propose an extended primal objective function arising from probability regularization leading to an automatic selection of {$\epsilon$}, and we can express {$\nu$} as an explicit function of {$\epsilon$}. The resultant hyperparameter values can be interpreted as `working' values required only in training but not testing or prediction. This regularized algorithm, namely {$\epsilon$}*-SVR, automatically provides a data-dependent {$\epsilon$} and is found to have a close connection to the {$\nu$}-support vector regression in the sense that {$\nu$} as a fraction is a sensible function of {$\epsilon$}. The {$\epsilon$}*-SVR automatically selects both {$\nu$} and {$\epsilon$} values. We illustrate these findings with some public benchmark datasets.},

  abstract = {The analysis of tensor data is necessary in many applications. Similar to bi-clustering of matrix data, multiscale co-clustering can simultaneously extract coherent patterns along all or partial modes of a tensor. However, numerical methods for co-clustering have not reached the level of maturity of bi-clustering. In this paper, we present a theoretical framework to perform co-clustering for multidimensional data based on tensor and matrix decomposition. According to the proposed principle, we first develop an alternative algorithm for tensor canonical decomposition with full-rank constraint on slice-wise factorization (FRSF). Owing to the least squares principle and the constraint inherent in the resolution of multidimensional data, FRSF provides a natural way to avoid two-factor degeneracy and renders the resolved profiles stable with respect to high dimensionality. FRSF maintains a high convergence rate and greatly reduces the computational complexity with the compression technique based on matrix singular value decomposition. Furthermore, the algebraic expression of co-clusters in tensor data can be mapped to some linear structures in the factor spaces of FRSF. We employ a linear grouping algorithm to identify these geometrical patterns in the factor spaces. Finally, the combination of the linear grouping points along every mode successfully supports the detection of co-clusters in tensor data. On the basis of the proposed framework, a flexible and fast FRSF-based co-clustering algorithm is developed. Extensive simulations and experiment data analysis demonstrate the validity and efficiency of FRSF and the proposed co-clustering algorithm.},

The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as honest nodes control the most CPU power on the network, they can generate the longest chain and outpace any attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

The specific methods tested here are an analytical method, a Mohr diagram method, two least squares methods and a constrained ellipse approach. The algorithms were tested on artificial datasets of known elliptical and noise properties. These results allow the selection of an ellipse fitting method in a variety of geological applications and also allow an assessment of the absolute and relative accuracy of a chosen method for various combinations of sample numbers and noise levels. For the most accurate semi axis magnitude and orientation estimates with five or more input data, the `mean object' least squares approach is recommended.

Recently, He et al. and Odelu et al. successively proposed pseudonym-based authentication key and agreement protocols for NFC after Eun et al.'s protocol (2013), which is first claimed to provide conditional privacy for NFC. They respectively claimed that their scheme can satisfy the security requirements. In this paper, first, we prove that their protocols still have security flaws, including the confusion of the user's identity and the random identity. Then, we propose a pseudonym-based secure authentication protocol (PSAP) for NFC applications, which is effective in lifetime and includes time synchronization-based method and nonce-based method. In our scheme, trusted service manager issues pseudonyms but does not need to maintain verification tables and it could reveal the user's identity of internal attackers. Furthermore, security and performance analysis proves that PSAP can provide traceability and more secure features with a little more cost.},

However, due to the limited computing power and storage capacity of IoT devices, users' health data are generally stored in a centralized third party, such as the hospital database or cloud, and make users lose control of their health data, which can easily result in privacy leakage and single-point bottleneck. In this paper, we propose Healthchain, a large-scale health data privacy preserving scheme based on blockchain technology, where health data are encrypted to conduct fine-grained access control. Specifically, users can effectively revoke or add authorized doctors by leveraging user transactions for key management. Furthermore, by introducing Healthchain, both IoT data and doctor diagnosis cannot be deleted or tampered with so as to avoid medical disputes. Security analysis and experimental results show that the proposed Healthchain is applicable for smart healthcare system.},

Traditionally, in order to access a network, a user is authorized with an identity and corresponding keys, which are generated and managed by the network operator. All users' personally identifying information are centralized stored by the network operator. However, this approach makes users lose the control of their personally identifying information. Users are concerned about who can access these sensitive data and whether they have been compromised. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based identity management and authentication scheme for mobile networks, where users' identifying information are controlled by the users themselves. Our scheme let users generate their self-sovereign identities (SSIs) and corresponding public keys and private keys. The private key used to authenticate the user's identifying information is only known to the user. We use blockchain to record SSIs and public keys of legitimate user, and adopt chameleon hash to delete illegal users' information on the blockchain, while keeping the block head unchanged. Furthermore, other service providers can obtain the user's SSI and public key and authenticate users by querying the blockchain. Experimental results confirm that our scheme can greatly reduce the revocation overhead and communication overhead.},

Although existing schemes improve blockchain throughput by allowing multiple miners to append blocks to the blockchain concurrently, little attention has been devoted to how to adjust blockchain throughput dynamically and how to avoid transaction duplication between concurrent blocks. This paper presents an adaptive scaling blockchain protocol with deduplication of transactions. When the transaction demand in the network is high, the blockchain expands to meet users' demand; when the transaction demand is low, the blockchain shrinks to save communication and storage costs. We design a transaction deduplication mechanism to ensure that no duplicate transactions are appended to the blockchain to improve bandwidth utilization and achieve higher effective throughput. Besides, the mining power load balancing mechanism can ensure the security of the blockchain by splitting adversaries' mining power. The proposed prototype has been implemented on Amazon EC2. The experiment results show that the proposed protocol achieves the dynamic throughput and reach xxxtpstransactions per second.},

In this article, I will explain coclustering algorithms for solving the coherent pattern-detection problem. In these methods, a coherent pattern corresponds to a low-rank matrix or tensor and can be represented as an intersection of hyperplanes in a high-dimensional space. We can then extract coherent patterns from the large data array by detecting hyperplanes. Examples will be provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the coclustering algorithms for solving unsupervised pattern classification problems.},

This feature is leading to a new trend that traditional wireless users are willing to roam to SIN to obtain a better service. However, the features of exposed links and higher signal latency in SIN make it difficult to design a secure and fast roaming authentication scheme for this new trend. Although some existing researches have been focused on designing secure authentication protocols for SIN or providing roaming authentication protocols for traditional wireless networks, these schemes cannot provide adequate requirements for the roaming communication in SIN and bring in critical issues, such as the privacy leakage or intolerable authentication delay. Observing these problems have not been well addressed, we design an anonymous and fast roaming authentication scheme for SIN. In our scheme, we utilize the group signature to provide the anonymity for roaming users, and assume that the satellites have limited computing capacity and make them have the defined authentication function to avoid the real-time involvement of the home network control center when authenticating the roaming users. The results of security and performance analysis show that the proposed scheme can provide the required security features, while providing a small authentication delay.},

To cope with this problem, an edge-following-based ellipse detection method is proposed which promotes the performances of the subprocesses based on consistency. The ellipse detector models edge connectivity by line segments and exploits inconsistent endpoints of the line segments to split the edge contours into smooth arcs. The smooth arcs are further refined with a novel arc refinement method which iteratively improves the consistency degree of the smooth arc. A two-phase arc integration method is developed to group disconnected elliptical arcs belonging to the same ellipse, and two constraints based on consistency are defined to increase the effectiveness and speed of the merging process. Finally, an efficient ellipse validation method is proposed to evaluate the saliency of the elliptic hypotheses. Detailed evaluation on synthetic images shows that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art ellipse detection methods in terms of effectiveness and speed. Additionally, we test our detector on three challenging real-world datasets. The F-measure score and execution time of results demonstrate that our method is effective and fast in complicated images. Therefore, the proposed method is suitable for practical applications.},

  abstract = {Co-clustering, often called biclustering for two-dimensional data, has found many applications, such as gene expression data analysis and text mining. Nowadays, a variety of multidimensional arrays (tensors) frequently occur in data analysis tasks, and co-clustering techniques play a key role in dealing with such datasets. Co-clusters represent coherent patterns and exhibit important properties along all the modes. Development of robust coclustering techniques is important for the detection and analysis of these patterns. In this paper, a co-clustering method based on hyperplane detection in singular vector spaces (HDSVS) is proposed. Specifically in this method, higher-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) transforms a tensor into a core part and a singular vector matrix along each mode, whose row vectors can be clustered by a linear grouping algorithm (LGA). Meanwhile, hyperplanar patterns are extracted and successfully supported the identification of multi-dimensional co-clusters. To validate HDSVS, a number of synthetic and biological tensors were adopted. The synthetic tensors attested a favorable performance of this algorithm on noisy or overlapped data. Experiments with gene expression data and lineage data of embryonic cells further verified the reliability of HDSVS to practical problems. Moreover, the detected co-clusters are well consistent with important genetic pathways and gene ontology annotations. Finally, a series of comparisons between HDSVS and state-of-the-art methods on synthetic tensors and a yeast gene expression tensor were implemented, verifying the robust and stable performance of our method.},
